## ğŸ¤– **Advanced Machine Learning Regression Techniques**

#### ğŸ”¹ **a. Decision Tree Regression**

* Models data by splitting based on feature values.

#### ğŸ”¹ **b. Random Forest Regression**

* Uses an ensemble of decision trees to improve predictions.

#### ğŸ”¹ **c. Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

* Uses support vector machines for regression tasks.

#### ğŸ”¹ **d. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**

* Predicts based on the average of K nearest data points.

#### ğŸ”¹ **e. Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBoost, LightGBM)**

* Builds strong models by combining weak learners sequentially.

#### ğŸ”¹ **f. Neural Network Regression**

* Uses deep learning models for complex non-linear regression.
