# 📚 **🌟 Robust Regression**

### **Introduction to Robust Regression**

Robust Regression is a type of regression analysis designed to produce **reliable parameter estimates even when the data violates the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression**, particularly the assumption of normally distributed errors and absence of outliers.

**Key aspects of Robust Regression include:**

* **Why Robust Regression?**
  Ordinary least squares regression is sensitive to outliers because it minimizes the sum of squared residuals, giving disproportionate influence to observations with large residuals. Robust regression methods reduce this sensitivity, providing estimates that are **more resistant to the effects of outliers or non-normal error distributions**.

* **Methods of Robust Regression:**
  Common robust regression techniques include:

  * **M-estimators:** Generalize maximum likelihood estimation by assigning reduced weights to outliers, using functions like Huber loss or Tukey’s biweight.
  * **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) Regression:** Minimizes the sum of absolute residuals instead of squared residuals, making it less sensitive to outliers.
  * **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus):** Iteratively fits models to random subsets of data to find the best model that fits the majority of the data points, ignoring outliers.

* **Interpretation:**
  The interpretation of coefficients in robust regression remains similar to OLS regression but with the added benefit that **estimates are not unduly influenced by outliers**.

* **Key advantages:**

  * **Resilience to outliers:** Provides more reliable results when data contains extreme values or deviations from assumptions.
  * **Better model fit:** For datasets with heavy-tailed error distributions or heteroscedasticity.
  * **Improved generalization:** By not being dominated by outlier observations.

* **Limitations:**

  * **Complexity:** Implementation and computation are more complex than OLS.
  * **Efficiency loss:** In purely clean datasets without outliers, robust methods may be less efficient than OLS.

* **Applications:**
  Robust regression is widely used in:

  * **Economic data analysis:** Where measurement errors or reporting outliers are common.
  * **Engineering and quality control:** To handle extreme but non-representative measurements.
  * **Environmental and biological sciences:** Where outlier values naturally occur due to rare events or measurement limitations.

Overall, robust regression is a **valuable tool for analysts and researchers** working with real-world data that often deviate from ideal assumptions, ensuring that the insights and predictions derived are both stable and trustworthy.

### 📝 **🔹 Step 0: Problem Setup**

**Example Problem:**
Predict **house price (Y)** based on **area (X)** when there are **outliers** in the data that can strongly affect ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates.

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Conceptual Overview**

✅ **What is Robust Regression?**

* Used when **data contains outliers** or **violates OLS assumptions**, making classical regression unreliable.
* **Down-weights the influence** of outliers for stable estimation.

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Import Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Create Sample Data with Outlier**

```python
# Sample data with an outlier
data = {
    'Area': [500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1700],
    'Price': [150000, 200000, 250000, 300000, 350000, 1000000]  # outlier at last point
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 4: Visualize Data**

```python
plt.scatter(df['Area'], df['Price'], color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.title('Scatter Plot with Outlier')
plt.show()
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 5: Fit Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for Comparison**

```python
X = sm.add_constant(df['Area'])
y = df['Price']

ols_model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(ols_model.summary())
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 6: Fit Robust Regression Model**

Using **Huber’s T norm** (commonly used robust method):

```python
robust_model = sm.RLM(y, X, M=sm.robust.norms.HuberT()).fit()
print(robust_model.summary())
```

✅ **Interpretation:**

* **Coefficients are less affected by outlier** compared to OLS.

---

### 🔹 **Step 7: Plot OLS vs Robust Regression**

```python
plt.scatter(df['Area'], df['Price'], color='blue', label='Data')

# OLS line
plt.plot(df['Area'], ols_model.predict(X), color='red', label='OLS')

# Robust Regression line
plt.plot(df['Area'], robust_model.predict(X), color='green', linestyle='--', label='Robust')

plt.xlabel('Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.title('OLS vs Robust Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### 🔹 **Step 8: Applicability of Robust Regression**

| **When to use?**                                                | **When not to use?**                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Data has **outliers or heavy-tailed errors**                    | Data follows **normal OLS assumptions** |
| You want **stable regression estimates** despite extreme values | No outliers or influential points       |
| Errors are not normally distributed                             |                                         |

---

### 🔹 **Step 9: Robust Regression Methods**

Besides **Huber’s T**, other robust methods include:

* **M-estimators**
* **Least Trimmed Squares**
* **RANSAC Regression** (Scikit-learn implementation for outlier removal)

Let me know if you wish to explore **RANSAC** in future advanced ML tutorials.
