# 📚 **🌟 Quantile Regression**


### **Introduction to Quantile Regression**

Quantile Regression is an advanced regression technique that extends the concept of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to estimate **conditional quantiles** (such as the median or the 90th percentile) of the dependent variable, rather than just the mean. This makes it a powerful tool for understanding how predictor variables affect the distribution of the outcome variable at different points.

**Key aspects of Quantile Regression include:**

* **Equation Form:**
  Similar to linear regression, quantile regression models the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable but focuses on estimating a specified quantile (τ) rather than the mean:

  $$
  Q_y(τ|x) = β_0(τ) + β_1(τ)x_1 + β_2(τ)x_2 + ... + β_k(τ)x_k
  $$

  where:

  * *Q\_y(τ|x)* is the τ-th conditional quantile of *y* given *x*,
  * *β\_j(τ)* are the coefficients estimated for the τ-th quantile.

* **Interpretation:**

  * Unlike OLS, which gives the **average effect** of predictors, quantile regression provides insights into how predictors affect different parts of the outcome distribution.
  * For example, it can reveal how an independent variable influences low-income earners differently from high-income earners in income data analysis.

* **Key advantages:**

  * **Robustness to outliers:** Quantile regression is less sensitive to outliers compared to mean regression, especially when estimating medians.
  * **Distributional insights:** Helps understand the impact of predictors across the entire distribution, not just the mean.
  * **Heterogeneous effects:** Useful when the relationship between variables varies at different outcome levels.

* **Applications:**
  Quantile regression is widely used in:

  * **Economics:** Analyzing wage distributions and income inequality.
  * **Healthcare research:** Studying how treatments affect patients differently at various outcome levels.
  * **Finance:** Estimating value-at-risk (VaR) by modeling the lower quantiles of return distributions.
  * **Environmental studies:** Modeling extreme events like heavy rainfall or pollution concentration.

* **Limitations:**

  * More computationally intensive than OLS.
  * Interpretation of coefficients is specific to the chosen quantile and differs from mean regression interpretation.

Overall, Quantile Regression is a **flexible and robust modeling technique** that provides a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the relationships within data, making it invaluable for researchers and analysts dealing with heterogeneous effects or non-normal error distributions.

### 📝 **🔹 Step 0: Problem Setup**

**Example Problem:**
Estimate the **median (50th percentile) house price** based on **area and bedrooms**, or analyze different quantiles (e.g. 25th, 75th) to understand distributional effects.

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Conceptual Overview**

✅ **What is Quantile Regression?**

* Unlike linear regression (predicts **mean** of dependent variable), quantile regression predicts **conditional quantiles** (e.g. median).
* Useful for:

  * **Skewed data** or non-normal error distributions.
  * Understanding **distributional impacts** of predictors.

### 🔹 **Step 2: Import Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Create Sample Data**

```python
# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Area': [500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500],
    'Bedrooms': [1, 2, 2, 3, 3],
    'Price': [150000, 200000, 250000, 300000, 350000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 4: Fit Quantile Regression Model**

```python
# Median regression (quantile=0.5)
model = smf.quantreg('Price ~ Area + Bedrooms', data=df)
result = model.fit(q=0.5)  # q=0.5 for median
print(result.summary())
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 5: Interpret Output**

✅ **Key points:**

* **Coefficients:** Effect of predictors on the **median price**.
* **Different quantiles** provide insights into **heterogeneous impacts** (e.g. impact may differ at lower vs upper price levels).

---

### 🔹 **Step 6: Predict for New Data**

```python
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Area': [1100, 1600],
    'Bedrooms': [2, 3]
})

predicted_median = result.predict(new_data)
print(predicted_median)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 7: Fit for Different Quantiles**

```python
# For 25th percentile
result_25 = model.fit(q=0.25)
print("25th percentile:\n", result_25.summary())

# For 75th percentile
result_75 = model.fit(q=0.75)
print("75th percentile:\n", result_75.summary())
```

✅ **Why this is powerful?**

* Shows **variation in predictor effects** across price distribution (e.g. impact may be stronger for expensive houses).

### 🔹 **Step 8: Applicability of Quantile Regression**

| **When to use?**                                           | **When not to use?**                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Interested in **predicting medians or other quantiles**    | Only interested in **mean prediction**        |
| **Skewed or heteroscedastic data**                         | Homoscedastic and normally distributed errors |
| Understanding **differential effects across distribution** | Simple linear modeling suffices               |
