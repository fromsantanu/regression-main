# 📚 **🌟 Non-linear Regression**

### **Introduction to Non-linear Regression**

Non-linear regression is a form of regression analysis used when the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable **cannot be adequately modeled by a straight line** or any linear combination of parameters. Instead, it fits a **non-linear equation** to the data, allowing for greater flexibility in capturing complex relationships.

**Key aspects of Non-linear Regression include:**

* **Equation Form:**
  Unlike linear regression, where the model is linear in parameters, non-linear regression models are represented by equations where parameters appear as exponents, in denominators, or within functions such as exponential, logarithmic, or sigmoidal forms. For example:

  $$
  y = β_0 + β_1 e^{β_2 x} + ε
  $$

  or

  $$
  y = \frac{β_0 x}{β_1 + x} + ε
  $$

  where:

  * *y* is the dependent variable,
  * *x* is the independent variable,
  * *β\_j* are model parameters,
  * *ε* is the error term.

* **Interpretation:**
  Non-linear regression estimates parameters that define the specific non-linear relationship, providing models that can capture curves, plateaus, saturation points, and other patterns not possible with linear models.

* **Key advantages:**

  * **Flexibility:** Can model a wide range of real-world relationships such as exponential growth, decay, logistic growth, Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and other biological or economic phenomena.
  * **Better fit:** Provides improved accuracy when the true underlying relationship is non-linear.

* **Limitations:**

  * **Complexity in estimation:** Requires iterative numerical methods to estimate parameters, as closed-form solutions often do not exist.
  * **Convergence issues:** May converge to local minima if initial parameter estimates are poor.
  * **Interpretability:** Interpretation of parameters is model-specific and often less intuitive compared to linear regression.

* **Applications:**
  Non-linear regression is widely used in:

  * **Pharmacokinetics:** Modeling drug concentration curves.
  * **Biological sciences:** Modeling growth rates (e.g. logistic or Gompertz models).
  * **Environmental studies:** Modeling pollutant decay or spread.
  * **Economics and engineering:** Modeling diminishing returns or saturation effects.

* **Comparison with Polynomial Regression:**
  While polynomial regression can model non-linear relationships, it remains a linear model in terms of parameters. Non-linear regression is truly non-linear both in form and parameters, making it suitable when polynomial approximations are inadequate.

Overall, non-linear regression is a **powerful tool for modeling complex, real-world relationships**, essential for advanced data analysis in scientific, engineering, and economic research contexts.

### 📝 **🔹 Step 0: Problem Setup**

**Example Problem:**
Fit a **non-linear model** where **house price (Y)** increases exponentially with **area (X)**.

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Conceptual Overview**

✅ **What is Non-linear Regression?**

* Models **non-linear relationships** between dependent and independent variables.
* The model equation is **non-linear in parameters**, e.g. exponential, logarithmic, logistic growth.

### 🔹 **Step 2: Import Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Create Sample Data**

```python
# Sample data with exponential growth pattern
data = {
    'Area': [500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500],
    'Price': [160000, 210000, 300000, 450000, 700000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 4: Define Non-linear Model Function**

For example, an **exponential growth model**:

$$
Price = a \times e^{b \times Area}
$$

```python
def exp_model(x, a, b):
    return a * np.exp(b * x)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 5: Fit Non-linear Regression Model**

```python
# Independent and dependent data
X = df['Area'].values
y = df['Price'].values

# Fit model
params, covariance = curve_fit(exp_model, X, y, p0=(1, 0.0001))  # p0 is initial guess
print(f"Parameters: a={params[0]}, b={params[1]}")
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 6: Make Predictions**

```python
# Generate predicted prices
y_pred = exp_model(X, *params)
print(y_pred)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 7: Plot Actual vs Fitted**

```python
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Actual')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Fitted')
plt.xlabel('Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.title('Non-linear Regression: Exponential Growth')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 8: Evaluate Model**

For non-linear models, **visual inspection** and **residual analysis** are often used. You can also compute:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```

✅ **Interpretation:**

* **R² near 1:** Good fit
* **MSE small:** Predictions close to actual

### 🔹 **Step 9: Applicability of Non-linear Regression**

| **When to use?**                                                        | **When not to use?**               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Relationship is **not linear** (e.g. exponential, logarithmic, sigmoid) | Relationship is linear             |
| Model equation is **known or theoretically derived**                    | Model form is unclear or arbitrary |
| Need to model **growth curves, decay, saturation**                      |                                    |
