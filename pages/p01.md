### üìä **What is Regression Analysis?**

**Regression analysis** is a **statistical method used to examine the relationship between two or more variables**. It helps us understand how the **dependent variable (target)** changes when any one of the **independent variables (predictors)** is varied.

#### üîë **Key Points:**

1. **Purpose:**

   * To **predict** the value of one variable based on others.
   * To **understand the strength and nature of relationships** between variables.

2. **Basic Concept:**

   * **Dependent Variable (Y):** The variable you are trying to predict or explain.
   * **Independent Variable(s) (X):** The variable(s) you are using to make predictions.

3. **Example:**

   * You want to predict **house prices** (Y) based on **area in square feet** (X).
   * Regression finds the **best-fit line** that represents this relationship:

   $$
   Y = a + bX
   $$

   Where:

   * $a$ is the **intercept** (value of Y when X = 0),
   * $b$ is the **slope** (how much Y changes with a unit change in X).

4. **Common Types of Regression:**

   * **Simple Linear Regression:** One independent variable.
   * **Multiple Linear Regression:** Two or more independent variables.
   * **Polynomial Regression:** Fits a curved line.
   * **Logistic Regression:** Used for **classification problems** (despite its name).

5. **Use Cases:**

   * Predicting sales based on advertising budget.
   * Estimating exam scores based on study hours.
   * Forecasting demand based on price.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**

Regression analysis **assumes** certain conditions, such as:

* Linearity
* Independence of errors
* Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors)
* Normality of errors (for inference)

Violating these can affect the validity of the model.
